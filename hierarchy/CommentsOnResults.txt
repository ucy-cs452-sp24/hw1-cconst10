Machine(s) used for the Memory metrics - Winsconsin Cluster - 2 nodes of c220g5

(1)Latency:
Local DRAM is fastest, typical for memory directly connected to the processor.
Local disk is slower, as accessing data from disk takes more time.
Remote memory over the network has the slowest latency due to network communication overhead.

(2)Bandwidth (BW):
Local DRAM has the highest data transfer rate, making it great for quick data access.
Local disk has slower data transfer compared to DRAM but offers a larger storage space.
Remote memory surprisingly shows good bandwidth(1000MB/s bottleneck, meaning no dropped packets until that value of transfer rate), indicating efficient network usage.

(3)Capacity:
Local disk offers the most storage space.
Local DRAM  has moderate capacity but very large if compared to commercial devices.
Remote memory capacity cannot be measured.

Key Points(Overall):
Different memory types have trade-offs in speed and storage capacity.
Local DRAM is fastest but may have limited space.
Local disk provides very large amount of storage but is slower.
Remote memory, despite network access, shows promising bandwidth.
